# 🧬 md_docs (Major Changes, History, and Reports)

[Back to root README](../../README.md)  
[Back to docs index](../README.md)

This folder contains documents that are:
- still **related** to the project, but represent **major historical changes**, prior states, or point-in-time reports
- preserved to show **how the project evolved**

## Folders

- `History/`
  - Project evolution snapshots, milestone narratives, and superseded-but-related docs.
- `Reports/`
  - Point-in-time generated reports (security/testing) preserved for audit trail.
- `Sessions/`
  - Session logs (what was done, why, outcomes).

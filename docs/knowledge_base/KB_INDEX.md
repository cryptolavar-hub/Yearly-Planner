This folder is the persistent knowledge base for this repository. It is intended to prevent repeated mistakes, preserve decisions, and make future fixes faster and safer.

## How this KB is used

- **Truth source**: Prefer code + logs + this KB over older free-form notes.
- **Session-based updates**: Each working session should produce or update:
  - a bug/issue register entry (if new issues discovered)
  - a short session log (what changed, what was learned, what is next)
- **Approval workflow**: No code changes are executed until CryptoLavar approves the proposed fix plan and impact analysis.
